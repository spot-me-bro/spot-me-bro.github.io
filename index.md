### Adherence to the GitHub hosting guidelines

Our team created SpotMeBro, a web platform designed to help students find gym partners, while adhering to GitHub hosting guidelines to ensure professionalism and maintainability. All source code for the project is hosted in a GitHub repository, enabling new developers to build the system locally without needing additional files from us. We established a dedicated GitHub organization named SpotMeBro, which includes a repository for the application code and a separate repository for the project’s homepage, hosted via GitHub Pages. The homepage includes an overview, user guide, developer guide, and development history making the project accessible and well-documented for users and developers alike. This structured approach ensures a collaborative and professional development environment, with clear documentation to support future contributors.
