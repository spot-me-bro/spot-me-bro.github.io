## Developer Guide



### Prerequisites üõ†Ô∏è
Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your system:

Node.js (v16 or higher) and npm
PostgreSQL (or any compatible SQL database)
A GitHub account


### How to Collaborate ü§ù
If you want to contribute, you must either clone or fork the repository:

Navigate to the SpotMeBro GitHub repository.
Click on Fork (if you want your own copy) or request to be added as a collaborator by the admin.
Clone the Repo:

> git clone https://github.com/spot-me-bro/SpotMeBro-nextjs.git
> cd SpotMeBro-nextjs

After cloning the repository, install the required dependencies using npm:

> npm install

You‚Äôll need a PostgreSQL database to store the system‚Äôs data.

Create a new database in your PostgreSQL instance (e.g., spotmebro_db).
Copy the database connection string (you‚Äôll need it for the next step).


Create a .env file in the project root directory and add your database connection string:

For example:

DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:password@localhost:5432/spotmebro_db


Run the following commands to set up the database schema and seed the initial data:

Run migrations to create the database tables:

> npx prisma migrate dev

Seed the database with default data:

> npx prisma db seed  

Once the database is set up and seeded, start the local development server:

> npm run dev

### Development History

#### Milestone #1:

[Here is the link to our M1 project page](https://github.com/orgs/spot-me-bro/projects/5)

For this Milestone, we set simple database models and pages/components.

#### Milestone #2:

[Here is the link to our M2 project page](https://github.com/orgs/spot-me-bro/projects/6)

The goal of this Milestone is to have a fully working application that references our database for information.

#### Milestone #3:

In M3 we will make a much more user friendly application, with coherent color schemes, design aspects, and overall aesthetic choices. With this will involve a lot of bug testing and trying to find as many edge cases as possible to test the app to the best of our abilities.

### Adherence to the GitHub hosting guidelines

Our team created SpotMeBro, a web platform designed to help students find gym partners, while adhering to GitHub hosting guidelines to ensure professionalism and maintainability. All source code for the project is hosted in a GitHub repository, enabling new developers to build the system locally without needing additional files from us. We established a dedicated GitHub organization named SpotMeBro, which includes a repository for the application code and a separate repository for the project‚Äôs homepage, hosted via GitHub Pages. The homepage includes an overview, user guide, developer guide, and development history making the project accessible and well-documented for users and developers alike. This structured approach ensures a collaborative and professional development environment, with clear documentation to support future contributors.
