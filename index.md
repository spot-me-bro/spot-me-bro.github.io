### Key Features

1. Gym Partner Matching: Match users with others based on their fitness level, experience, and workout preferences.
2. Profile Customization: Users create and manage their profiles, including fitness goals and availability.
3. Workout Plans (Extra feature): Optionally, users can browse workout plans based on their fitness goals.


### Technology Used

* [Node.js](https://www.nodejs.com/) for Javascript-based client and server code implementation.
* [React](https://reactjs.org/) for component-based UI implementation and routing.
* [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/) CSS Framework for UI design.
* [Uniforms](https://uniforms.tools/) for React and Semantic UI-based form design and display.
* [Postgresql](https://www.postgresql.org/) for SQL database management

### User Guide
Users will be able to create profiles that show their abilities in five different categories (Push, Pull, Legs, Full Body, Cardio). Once a user is registered, they can log into the application and will be prompted to tell what type of workout they are interested in doing today. The application will then match users with similar capabilities and interests and provide them with each other’s contact information.
